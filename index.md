### About Me:
My nicknames vary greatly, but generally people call me Jonathan or JD. ***All other nicknames must be manually discovered in order to unlock their usage.*** I'm 21 years old and have lived in San Diego my entire life. I went to La Jolla High School and played indoor & beach volleyball. I am also Catholic.
### About Me in Terms of Programming:
My programming experience began junior year of high school in which I chose out of interest from my childhood experiences with video games. I like to think that ~~some of~~ the games I used to play really do improves one's ability to code and understand code behavior. In terms of non-academic experience, I have only made a small Java game and am currently working on a larger-scale board game in Unity. It does not look like much experience but I promise I'm good at coding. I also took a C++ course at Stanford in 2017.
I don't have anything to show for the Unity game yet, but [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf_Rdp6zsw4) is very similar to what it will look like.
> "What's your favorite kind of code to type Jonathan?"

My favorite kind of code to type is probably when you use non void functions for something that's not just assignment.
>"Can you please give an example of this Jonathan??"

Ok.

Here's my most recent list of piano music that I've been learning:
